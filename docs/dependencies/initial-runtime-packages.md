## @modelcontextprotocol/client@2.3.1

- Release: 2026-10-05; stable SDK v2 split package.

- License: Apache-2.0.
- Security: upgrades past [GHSA-6qxp-vccf-f47h](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6qxp-vccf-f47h); OSV reports no advisory for this version, and the lockfile npm audit reports no runtime advisory at admission.
- Rationale: official MCP client, Streamable HTTP transport, and automatic
  legacy/modern protocol negotiation for upstream connections; Node built-ins do not implement MCP.

- Security: paired with patched client 2.3.1; OSV reports no advisory for this version, and the lockfile npm audit reports no runtime advisory at admission.
- Rationale: shared official MCP wire types and validation used by the client,
