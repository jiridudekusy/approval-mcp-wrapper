# MCP Compatibility

The public `/mcp` endpoint accepts both protocol generations supported by the
stable TypeScript SDK v2:

- legacy MCP through the 2025-11-25 Streamable HTTP lifecycle;
- modern MCP 2026-07-28 through `server/discover` and typed modern requests.

The endpoint keeps the same bearer-token authentication, validation of Origin
when a client supplies that header,
token-scoped tool catalog, policy checks, approval flow, and audit records in
both modes. Upstream connections use automatic negotiation: they try the modern
discovery flow first and fall back to the legacy lifecycle when the upstream is
not modern-capable.

## Browser-based OAuth sign-in

New clients can connect to the public `https://<your-host>/mcp` URL without a
manually created agent token. An unauthenticated request receives an OAuth
protected-resource challenge. The server advertises authorization-server
metadata and supports dynamic registration of public clients, authorization
code with S256 PKCE, and rotating refresh tokens. A browser opens the consent
page; after passkey sign-in, the administrator sees the unverified client name,
client ID and exact callback URL, chooses one access profile and a lifetime
between one hour and seven days, and confirms with the passkey again. Denying
the request returns an OAuth error to the client. There is no Device Flow.

The resulting agent appears in **Access → Agents**, labelled OAuth, with its
expiry. Delete it there to revoke access immediately. Changing its chosen
profile requires revocation and another sign-in. OAuth clients cannot receive
the MCP management permission or a manually rotated token. Existing manually
created `amcp_` agent tokens continue to work. OAuth changes *how* the client
obtains a token; MCP HTTP requests still carry a short-lived
`Authorization: Bearer` access token. Individual tool approvals continue to
apply to the selected profile.

The callback must be reachable by the browser that completes the sign-in.
`http://localhost` and other loopback callback URLs refer to that browser's
machine, which matters if the sandbox runs on another host. HTTPS callbacks
are also accepted. This implementation supports Dynamic Client Registration;
clients that only support Client ID Metadata Documents are not yet compatible.
Multiple explicitly configured MCP origins are supported; the authorization
page remains on the public passkey origin, while discovery, registration,
tokens, and MCP requests use the client's chosen origin. Access tokens are
bound to that origin. MCP OAuth clients generally require HTTPS for any
non-loopback token endpoint, including a private network IP; see the
[deployment settings](deployment.md) before connecting from a sandbox.

The approval wait remains a normal blocking `tools/call` response. MCP Tasks are
not advertised. In protocol 2026-07-28, Tasks moved to the experimental
`io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks` extension, and no production TypeScript
extension package is currently published. The existing approval coordinator is
kept independent from the transport so a standard Tasks adapter can be added
when the official extension surface is available. Until then, advertising a
private look-alike would create incompatible clients and is intentionally
avoided.

Compatibility is covered by integration tests that connect one legacy client
and one auto-negotiating modern client to the same authenticated gateway and
exercise tool listing, inspection, allowed calls, and denied calls.

## Approval MCP's own tools

The profile editor shows a virtual **Approval MCP** upstream. Its tool rules
apply through the same policy, approval, and audit flow as external tools. The
available names are `approval_mcp__inspect_tool`, `approval_mcp__list_upstreams`,
`approval_mcp__get_tool_info`, `approval_mcp__list_history`,
`approval_mcp__get_history_event`, `approval_mcp__list_all_history`,
`approval_mcp__get_any_history_event`, `approval_mcp__get_upstream_health`, and
`approval_mcp__refresh_upstream_tools`. There is no approval-status polling tool:
an approval waits in its original call.

Only `inspect_tool` retains its historical default availability when no
profile rule exists. Other self tools are hidden until configured in a profile.
The ordinary history tools restrict results to the authenticated MCP token;
knowing another call ID does not grant access. The separate `list_all_history`
and `get_any_history_event` tools can read redacted history across agents. They,
like the health and refresh tools, require both an explicit profile rule and
the agent's **MCP management** permission. History pages use stable
first-seen-time cursors; a cursor is valid only with the filters that produced it.
This permission can be set when creating an agent or changed later in its
settings without changing its token. Management tokens should be kept separate
from ordinary agent tokens and rotated or deleted when no longer needed. A
rotated token keeps the agent's profiles but immediately invalidates the old
secret; deleting an agent also removes its active grants and profile assignments
while retaining its identity in audit history. No self tool can approve or
change a profile rule.
